## Project Overview
Introduction
In this project, I have developed a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create realistic images of human faces. These images feature celebrities and are generated using the CelebA dataset, which has been preprocessed for this purpose.

Processed CelebA Face Data

##Model Training and Results
After training the GAN for 100 epochs, the model has learned to generate high-quality facial images. Here are some examples of faces generated by the model:

Generated Faces

These generated faces showcase the capabilities of the GAN in producing realistic facial features.
